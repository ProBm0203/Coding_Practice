<h1>Coding_Practice</h1>
To improve my coding skills, I did a little practice in a few websites (HackerRank, codility, leetcode, ...). The main reason for creating this repo is that I want to record all the "mind workings" in this process.The coding is actually done in python, but you can add your solution or suggestions in any language.
